**4.4 Practice**

**Why does this code not work?**

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varlable
```

**Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)**

object called in the second line does not match the object name


**Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```



**Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?**


```{r}

```

keyboard shortcut reference menu apppears

you can get the same place using the Tools menu then choosing the keyboard shortcut help.
